## Description

I'm not describing this plugin.  Don't use it.

## Installation

Don't install it either.

## FAQ

Not one.  It would be rude of me to say 'Don't ask either', so I won't say it.  You can ask.  I might even answer.

## Changelog

### 0.1.0
* Initial write-up of core code.  Non-function right now, just takes up space.
